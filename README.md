# Simple Object Detector
#### This Python project is a user-friendly tool for automatically detecting objects within images. It uses a deep learning model to identify objects and provides a summary of the results, along with details on where each object is located in the image.

## Key Features:

Automatic Object Detection
Summary Report
Detailed Object Locations
Customizable Model (Optional)


## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Keras
TensorFlow
OpenCV


## Installation:

Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries: pip install keras tensorflow opencv-python


## Usage:

Replace /content/objdec.jpg in the code with the path to your image.
Run the script.

## Limitations:

It cannot detect objects which appear large in the image and can detect only a few objects in the image.
