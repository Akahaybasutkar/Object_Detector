# Object_Detector
This Python project uses a deep learning model to automatically detect objects in images, providing both a summary of what's found and detailed information about where each object is located.
# Simple Object Detector

This Python project is a straightforward image object detection tool. It utilizes a deep learning model to automatically identify and locate objects within images. 

## Key Features

* **Automatic Object Detection:** Identifies objects in images without manual intervention.
* **Summary Report:** Provides a concise overview of all detected objects.
* **Detailed Location:** Pinpoints the exact position of each object within the image.

## How It Works (High-Level)

1. **Load Image:** Provide the path to your image.
2. **Detect Objects:** The tool analyzes your image and finds objects.
3. **Get Results:** Receive a summary of detected objects and a detailed report with object locations.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.x
   * Keras
   * TensorFlow
   * OpenCV
   * Install them using `pip install keras tensorflow opencv-python`

2. **Installation:**
